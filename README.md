# DOCKER CHROME

![Docker Chrome Build](https://github.com/MarcelleBond/Docker_Chrome/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This is a docker image runs xpra which we use to run google chrome from within the docker container and make it viewable from the web browser.
The Chrome instance has a plugin installed to stream music on different sites from a playlist given to it.

This can be modified to run what ever program you would like and view it in the browser. 
Please be warned that this uses A LOT OF RAM on the users machine

There are a few issue that need to be sorted out but not sure as yet how to get around them.

## Issues:
  1. Copy and past doesn't seem to be working.
  2. Theres no audio that comes out.
  3. It sometimes crashes.

Feel free to use this image and make improvements to it
